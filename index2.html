    <h1>Cambodia</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>Cambodia (/kæmˈboʊdiə/ (About this sound listen);[6] Khmer: កម្ពុជា, or Kampuchea: IPA: [kam.pu.ciə], French: Cambodge),
        officially the Kingdom of Cambodia (Khmer: ព្រះរាជាណាចក្រកម្ពុជា, prĕəh riəciənaacak kampuciə, IPA: [prĕəh riə.ciə.naː.caʔ
        kam.pu.ciə]; French: Royaume du Cambodge), is a sovereign state located in the southern portion of the Indochina
        peninsula in Southeast Asia. It is 181,035 square kilometres (69,898 square miles) in area, bordered by Thailand
        to the northwest, Laos to the northeast, Vietnam to the east and the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest. Cambodia
        has a population of over 15 million. The official religion is Theravada Buddhism, practised by approximately 95 percent
        of the population. The country's minority groups include Vietnamese, Chinese, Chams and 30 hill tribes.[7] The capital
        and largest city is Phnom Penh, the political, economic and cultural centre of Cambodia. The kingdom is an elective
        constitutional monarchy with a monarch, currently Norodom Sihamoni, chosen by the Royal Throne Council as head of
        state. The head of government is the Prime Minister, currently Hun Sen, the longest serving non-royal leader in Southeast
        Asia, ruling Cambodia since 1985.</p>

    <h3>1. History</h3>


    <p id="his">There exists sparse evidence for a Pleistocene human occupation of present-day Cambodia, which includes quartz
        and quartzite pebble tools found in terraces along the Mekong River, in Stung Treng and Kratié provinces, and in
        Kampot Province, although their dating is unreliable.[25] Some slight archaeological evidence shows communities of
        hunter-gatherers inhabited the region during Holocene: the most ancient archaeological discovery site in Cambodia
        is considered to be the cave of L'aang Spean, in Battambang Province, which belongs to the Hoabinhian period. Excavations
        in its lower layers produced a series of radiocarbon dates around 6000 BC.[25][26] Upper layers in the same site
        gave evidence of transition to Neolithic, containing the earliest dated earthenware ceramics in Cambodia[27] Archaeological
        records for the period between Holocene and Iron Age remain equally limited. A pivotal event in Cambodian prehistory
        was the slow penetration of the first rice farmers from the north, which began in the late 3rd millennium BC.[28]
        The most curious prehistoric evidence in Cambodia are the various "circular earthworks" discovered in the red soils
        near Memot and in the adjacent region of Vietnam in the latter 1950s. Their function and age are still debated, but
        some of them possibly date from 2nd millennium BC.[29][30] Khmer army going to war against the Cham, from a relief
        on the Bayon Other prehistoric sites of somewhat uncertain date are Samrong Sen (not far from the ancient capital
        of Oudong), where the first investigations began in 1875,[31] and Phum Snay, in the northern province of Banteay
        Meanchey.[32] An excavation at Phum Snay revealed 21 graves with iron weapons and cranial trauma which could point
        to conflicts in the past, possible with larger cities in Angkor.[28][33] [34] Prehistoric artefacts are often found
        during mining activities in Ratanakiri.[25] Iron was worked by about 500 BC, with supporting evidence coming from
        the Khorat Plateau, in modern-day Thailand. In Cambodia, some Iron Age settlements were found beneath Baksei Chamkrong
        and other Angkorian temples while circular earthworks were found beneath Lovea a few kilometres north-west of Angkor.
        Burials, much richer than other types of finds, testify to improvement of food availability and trade (even on long
        distances: in the 4th century BC trade relations with India were already opened) and the existence of a social structure
        and labour organisation. Also, among the artefacts from the Iron Age, glass beads are important evidence. Different
        kinds of glass beads recovered from several sites across Cambodia, such as the Phum Snay site in northwest and the
        Prohear site in southeast, show that there were two main trading networks at the time. The two networks were separated
        by time and space, which indicate that there was a shift from one network to the other at about 2nd–4th century AD,
        probably with changes in socio-political powers.[35]</p>

    <h3>2. Geography</h3>
    <p id="geo">
        Regional map of Cambodia Cambodia has an area of 181,035 square kilometres (69,898 square miles) and lies entirely within
        the tropics, between latitudes 10° and 15°N, and longitudes 102° and 108°E. It borders Thailand to the north and
        west, Laos to the northeast, and Vietnam to the east and southeast. It has a 443-kilometre (275-mile) coastline along
        the Gulf of Thailand.[6][77] Cambodia's landscape is characterised by a low-lying central plain that is surrounded
        by uplands and low mountains and includes the Tonle Sap (Great Lake) and the upper reaches of the Mekong River delta.
        Extending outward from this central region are transitional plains, thinly forested and rising to elevations of about
        650 feet (200 metres) above sea level. To the north the Cambodian plain abuts a sandstone escarpment, which forms
        a southward-facing cliff stretching more than 200 miles (320 kilometres) from west to east and rising abruptly above
        the plain to heights of 600 to 1,800 feet (180–550 metres). This cliff marks the southern limit of the Dângrêk Mountains.
        Flowing south through the country's eastern regions is the Mekong River. East of the Mekong the transitional plains
        gradually merge with the eastern highlands, a region of forested mountains and high plateaus that extend into Laos
        and Vietnam. In southwestern Cambodia two distinct upland blocks, the Krâvanh Mountains and the Dâmrei Mountains,
        form another highland region that covers much of the land area between the Tonle Sap and the Gulf of Thailand. In
        this remote and largely uninhabited area, Phnom Aural, Cambodia's highest peak rises to an elevation of 5,949 feet
        (1,813 metres).[78] The southern coastal region adjoining the Gulf of Thailand is a narrow lowland strip, heavily
        wooded and sparsely populated, which is isolated from the central plain by the southwestern highlands. The most distinctive
        geographical feature is the inundations of the Tonle Sap, measuring about 2,590 square kilometres (1,000 square miles)
        during the dry season and expanding to about 24,605 square kilometres (9,500 square miles) during the rainy season.
        This densely populated plain, which is devoted to wet rice cultivation, is the heartland of Cambodia.[79] Much of
        this area has been designated as a biosphere reserve.[79]</p>

    <h3>3. Politics</h3>
    <p id="pol">
        National politics in Cambodia take place within the framework of the nation's constitution of 1993. The government is a constitutional
        monarchy operated as a parliamentary representative democracy. The Prime Minister of Cambodia, an office held by
        Hun Sen since 1985, is the head of government, while the King of Cambodia (currently Norodom Sihamoni) is the head
        of state. The prime minister is appointed by the king, on the advice and with the approval of the National Assembly.
        The prime minister and the ministerial appointees exercise executive power. Legislative powers are shared by the
        executive and the bicameral Parliament of Cambodia (សភាតំណាងរាស្ត្រ, saphea damnang reastr), which consists of a
        lower house, the National Assembly (រដ្ឋសភា, rotsaphea) and an upper house, the Senate (ព្រឹទ្ធសភា, protsaphea).
        Members of the 123-seat Assembly are elected through a system of proportional representation and serve for a maximum
        term of five years. The Senate has 61 seats, two of which are appointed by the king and two others by the National
        Assembly, and the rest elected by the commune councillors from 24 provinces of Cambodia. Senators serve six-year
        terms.[99] On 14 October 2004, King Norodom Sihamoni was selected by a special nine-member Royal Throne Council,
        part of a selection process that was quickly put in place after the abdication of King Norodom Sihanouk a week prior.
        Sihamoni's selection was endorsed by Prime Minister Hun Sen and National Assembly Speaker Prince Norodom Ranariddh
        (the king's half-brother and current chief advisor), both members of the throne council. He was enthroned in Phnom
        Penh on 29 October 2004. Officially a multiparty democracy, in reality "the country remains a one-party state dominated
        by the Cambodian People's Party and Prime Minister Hun Sen, a recast Khmer Rouge official in power since 1985. The
        open doors to new investment during his reign have yielded the most access to a coterie of cronies of his and his
        wife, Bun Rany."[attribution needed][100] Cambodia's government has been described by the Human Rights Watch's Southeast
        Asian director, David Roberts, as a "vaguely communist free-market state with a relatively authoritarian coalition
        ruling over a superficial democracy".[16]

    <h3>4. Economy</h3>
    <p id="econ">
        In 2017 Cambodia's per capita income is $4,022 in PPP and $1,309 in nominal per capita. Cambodia graduated from the status
        of a Least Developed Country to a Lower Middle Income country in the same year 2016. Most rural households depend
        on agriculture and its related sub-sectors. Rice, fish, timber, garments and rubber are Cambodia's major exports.
        The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) reintroduced more than 750 traditional rice varieties to Cambodia
        from its rice seed bank in the Philippines.[128] These varieties had been collected in the 1960s. Based on the Economist,
        IMF: Annual average GDP growth for the period 2001–2010 was 7.7% making it one of the world's top ten countries with
        the highest annual average GDP growth. Tourism was Cambodia's fastest growing industry, with arrivals increasing
        from 219,000 in 1997 to over 2 million in 2007. In 2004, inflation was at 1.7% and exports at $1.6 billion US$. In
        the Cambodia country assessment "Where Have All The Poor Gone? Cambodia Poverty Assessment 2013", the World Bank
        concludes: "Over the seven years from 2004 through 2011, Cambodian economic growth was tremendous, ranking amid the
        best in the world. Moreover, household consumption increased by nearly 40 percent. And this growth was pro-poor—not
        only reducing inequality, but also proportionally boosting poor people's consumption further and faster than that
        of the non-poor. As a result, the poverty rate dropped from 52.2 to 20.5 percent, surpassing all expectations and
        far exceeding the country's Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) poverty target. However, the majority of these people
        escaped poverty only slightly: they remain highly vulnerable—even to small shocks—which could quickly bring them
        back into poverty."[129] "Two decades of economic growth have helped make Cambodia a global leader in reducing poverty.
        The success story means the Southeast Asian nation that overcame a vicious civil war now is classified as a lower-middle
        income economy by the World Bank Group (WBG). Among 69 countries that have comparable data, Cambodia ranked fourth
        in terms of the fastest poverty reduction in the world from 2004–2008. (See more details of Cambodia's achievements
        on poverty reduction. The poverty rate fell to 10 percent in 2013, and further reduction of poverty is expected for
        both urban and rural households throughout 2015–2016. However, human development, particularly in the areas of health
        and education, remains an important challenge and development priority for Cambodia"[130]

    <h3>5. Society</h3>
    <p id="society">

        An ethnic map of Cambodia The vast majority of Cambodia's population is of ethnic Khmer origin (over 95%) who are speakers
        of the Khmer language, the country's sole official language. Cambodia's population is largely homogeneous. Its minority
        groups include Chams (1.2%), Vietnamese (0.1%) and Chinese (0.1%).[1] The largest ethnic group in Cambodia are the
        Khmers, who comprise around 90% of the total population in Cambodia, and are indigenous to the lowland Mekong subregion
        in which they inhabit. The Khmers historically have lived near the lower Mekong River in a contiguous diagonal arc,
        from where modern-day Thailand, Laos and Cambodia meet in the northwest, all the way to the mouth of the Mekong River
        in southeastern Vietnam. The Vietnamese are the second largest ethnic minority in Cambodia, with an estimated 16,000
        living in provinces concentrated in the southeast of the country adjacent to the Mekong Delta. Although the Vietnamese
        language has been determined to be a Mon–Khmer language, there are very few cultural connections between the two
        peoples because the early Khmers were influenced by the Indian cultural sphere while the Vietnamese are part of the
        Chinese cultural sphere.[164] Due to Chinese influence, Vietnamese has developed into a solidly tonal language, while
        Khmer has preserved the non-tonal nature of Old Austroasiatic. Ethnic tensions between the Khmer and the Vietnamese
        can be traced to the Dark Ages of Cambodia (from the 16th to 19th centuries), during which time a nascent Vietnam
        and Thailand each attempted to vassalise a weakened post-Angkor Cambodia, and effectively dominate all of Indochina.[164]
        Chinese Cambodians are approximately 0.1% of the population.[161][165] Most Chinese are descended from 19th–20th-century
        settlers who came in search of trade and commerce opportunities during the time of the French protectorate. Most
        are urban dwellers, engaged primarily in commerce.
